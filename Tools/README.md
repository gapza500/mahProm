# PetReady Development Tools

This directory hosts helper utilities that accelerate development and deployment workflows for the multi-app ecosystem.

- `code-generator/`: scripts and templates that scaffold SwiftUI views, models, or API layers.
- `testing-frameworks/`: shared XCTest helpers, mock servers, and contract-testing harnesses.
- `deployment-automation/`: CI/CD support utilities (Fastlane lanes, Terraform helpers, etc.).

Populate each folder with dedicated tooling as features mature.
